This below code generates 5 random items from list without replacement.
```R
boxno <- c("C1","C2","C3","C4","C6","C7","C8","C9","C10","D1","D4","D5","D7","D9","D10")
set.seed(1904)
sample <- split(sample(boxno), rep(1:(length(boxno)/5), each=5))
sample 
```
<br>

The below code outputs duration of all audio files in a folder into a speadsheet. <br>
Note: You can output any of the property of audio file e.g. duartion, amplitude etc. Please refer to soundgen library.

```R
library(soundgen)
library(tuneR)          #install both packages if you have not already
audio<-readWave("C:/Users/Prateek Sahu/Desktop/Vocalisation/malesGraGra0201_110701-DC-36f.wav", header=TRUE) # length of audio file for a single file
audio$samples / audio$sample.rate

fnam=file.path("C:/Users/Prateek Sahu/Desktop/Vocalisation/males") #file path of the folder
filist=list.files(fnam, recursive=TRUE, pattern="wav")
filist1=paste(fnam, "/", filist, sep="")
nfiles=length(filist1)
test_length=c("Full File Path", "length") #some formating for pasting below time duration 
for (i in 1:nfiles){
  inname <- filist1[i]
  audio <- readWave(inname, header = TRUE)
  L<- round(((audio$samples / audio$sample.rate) * 1000),2)
  test_length <- rbind(test_length, c(inname, L))
}
# the for loop goes through all files of the folder and calculate the length of the audio 
library(xlsx)
write.xlsx(test_length, "C:/Users/Prateek Sahu/Desktop/Vocalisation/males/length.xlsx")
# this writes the all duration of audio files in the xlsx file format
```
