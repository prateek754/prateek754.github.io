&emsp; Attened the play "Monsters in the Dark" by [Bangalore Little Theatre] , which was organised by [C-CAMP]. It is a stage adaptation of Siddhartha Mukherjee's 2011 Pulitzer Prize winning book, 'Emperor of All Maladies'. It was really cool to see the life and history of cancer treatment and research through the point of view of Sidney Farber, Gordon Zubrod, Carla Reed and others. Three mice portray the story of the oncogene. They did a great job. The play was also kind of funny. Overall, it was really nice.
