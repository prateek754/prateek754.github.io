&emsp;&emsp;Attened few talks from [Swissnex ScienceComm'18]. The talk by Adria LeBoeuf & Samuel Lagier on 
facilitating communication and collaboration using improv & play was too much fun. The talk by Rajesh Tahil 
co-founder of [Audiomatic podcast] was not that good but the concept was good. And some of the episodes of the 
podcast [The intersection] are great. Leslee Lazar explained the importance of visual communication in science 
through a historical journey of data visualization in his talk.
