I am Prateek, currently a graduate student at University of Alberta, Canada in [Pyschology department](https://www.ualberta.ca/psychology) under [Dr. Christopher Sturdy](https://www.ualberta.ca/science/about-us/contact-us/faculty-directory/christopher-sturdy). I am working on song birds at [Songbird Neuroetholgy Lab](https://songbirdneuroethologylab.weebly.com/).


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have completed my 5 Year Integrated BS-MS degree from [IISER Kolkata](http://www.iiserkol.ac.in/), India,in the department of Biological Sciences. I was working in the [ant lab](http://www.iiserkol.ac.in/~antlab/) under [Dr. Sumana Annagiri](http://www.iiserkol.ac.in/~antlab/principal_investigator.html) on [reunification of artifically fragmented *Diacamma indicum*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2018.10.017) ant colonies.
